This project challenges you to build a comprehensive website for the TechCon 2024 conference using HTML. You’ll create various webpages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the conference, while incorporating essential HTML elements and best practices.

// Project Scope:
The website will consist of five core webpages:

1. Homepage (index.html): This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.

2. About Page (about.html): This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.

3. Schedule Page (schedule.html): This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.

4. Register Page (register.html): This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.

5. Contact Page (contact.html): This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.

// Concepts Covered:
Throughout this project, you’ll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

* HTML Structure: You’ll solidify your understanding of fundamental HTML tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.

* Headings and Text: You’ll learn to structure headings (h1-h6) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (<p>) and other text formatting elements effectively.

* Links and Navigation: You’ll implement hyperlinks (<a> tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.

* Tables: You’ll create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.

* Forms: You’ll design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the <form> tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.

* Images and Multimedia: You’ll incorporate images (using <img> tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. You’ll also explore embedding a promotional video (using the <video> tag) and an interactive Google Map (using <iframe>) on the Contact page.


By successfully completing this project, you’ll gain valuable hands-on experience building a real-world website with HTML. This will serve as a solid foundation for you to explore more advanced web development concepts like CSS and JavaScript in the future.
